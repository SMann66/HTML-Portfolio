<h1>Best Movies by Sharon</h1><br>
<h2>My top three movies of all time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>The Lord of the Rings, Trilogy</h3>
<p>Peter Jacksons take on The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien is by 
    far the best film adaptaion of the books.
</p>
<h3>The Hobbit</h3>
<p>Peter Jackson does another brilliant take on another of J.R.R. Tolkien's books, The Hobbit.
    This is a fun, fantasy book.
</p>
<h3>Xmen</h3>
<p>Too many movies to post here, there is no one favorite. They are all my favorites!</p>
